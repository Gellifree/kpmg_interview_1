## Overall experience
 - The implementation for the second excersise took about 4-5 hours, and contains a really long function which probably should be sliced to smaller parts.
 - Not sure if i understood the fifth excercise correctly.
 - The recursive solution in the sixth excercise would probably need to be refactored
